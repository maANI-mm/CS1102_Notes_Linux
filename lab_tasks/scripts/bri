# control brightness

# Usage
# bri       -> outputs current brightness level
# bri up    -> increases brightness
# bri down  -> decreases brightness
# bri 90   -> sets brightness to 90
# bri +50   -> increases brightness by 50
# bri -10   -> decreases brightness by 10

# change this value to the number of levels you want brightness inc/dec to have
levels=5
