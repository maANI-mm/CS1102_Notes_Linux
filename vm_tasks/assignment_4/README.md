# Assignment 4

Create an account in GitHub and create a public repository named `cs1102-<roll_number>` (in lowercase) and initialize with README.md

Create a file named `script.sh` that exports two shell variables

- `GITHUB_USERNAME` that holds the GitHub username Ex: "bsccs1102"
- `GITHUB_REPOSITORY` that holds the GitHub repository name Ex: "cs1102-21f1000000"

The repository can be deleted after the evaluation and submission of Assignment 5 is successful.
