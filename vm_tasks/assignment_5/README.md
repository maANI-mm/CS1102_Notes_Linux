# Assignment 5

Clone the repository that is created in Assignment 4 and keep it in ~/cs1102/assignment_5/cs1102-<roll_number>/

Create a file named `script.sh` that exports two shell variables

- `GITHUB_USERNAME` that holds the GitHub username Ex: "bsccs1102"
- `GITHUB_REPOSITORY` that holds the GitHub repository name Ex: "cs1102-21f1000000"

**Sample file structure**

```
~/cs1102/assignment_5/
└── cs1102-21f1000000
    └── README.md
```
